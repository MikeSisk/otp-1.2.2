Added includes of <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h> to random.c to avoid
a GCC -Wall natter about exit() not being defined.

Modified all of the function names in random.c and references
to them in otp.c to prefix the names with "o_".  This avoid conflicts
with the system-supplied random() functions if pulled in by header
files we include.

Added a version number (1.2 for this release) and date to the -u option
output.

Created a test.sh test script for Unix separate from the test.bat file
for DOS/Windows.  Added "./" prefix to run the program from the
local directory.  Changed the self-test target in the Makefile from
"test" to "check".

Converted otp.c, random.c, and md5.c to ANSI C.  Made the byteReverse
internal utility function in md5.c static.

When building for Unix, if the system implements /dev/random and
we're generating a random seed, 16 bits of entropy from that source
is stirred into the mix.

Added WIN32 code to otp.c to obtain assorted entropy from
Windows API calls.

Created Visual Studio .NET Onetime.sln and Onetime.vcproj
files to build a Win32 console application.  Built and
tested with the test.bat script.  The executable, which is
built as Release\Onetime.exe was copied to otp.exe
in the main directory.

2012 June 6

Applied to patches from Colin Tuckley to correct problems when
building on 64-bit architectures.

Updated version to 1.2.1, May 2012.

2014 June 2

Fixed an inconsistency in the declaration of o_random() between
random.c and otp.c, and in the process converted the entire program
to use <stdint.h> and its types throughout, eliminating the ugly
and non-portable sensing of architectures within the code.

Corrected a sizeof() reference to a pointer to a structure in
md5.c which caused a warning in gcc 4.8.1.

Changed the make target to build the distribution to "dist" in
keeping with contemporary community standards.

Modified the distribution creation procedure to make a distribution
which unpacks into a directory named otp-$(VERSION) rather than the
current directory.

Updated version to 1.2.2, June 2014.
